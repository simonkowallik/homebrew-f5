## Homebrew Tap
This is my homebrew tap for F5 related tools.

Use `brew install simonkowallik/f5/<tool>` too install.

If you like this tap, add it with `brew tap simonkowallik/f5`.

Adding the tap will provide you with updates when running `brew update`/`brew upgrade`.
It also makes installation simpler with `brew install <tool>`.
